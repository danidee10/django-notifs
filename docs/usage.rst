Quick start
-----------

To Create/Send a notification import the notify function and call it with the following arguments::

    from notifications.utils import notify

    kwargs = {
        'source': self.request.user,
        'source_display_name': self.request.user.get_full_name(),
        'recipient': recipent_user, 'category': 'Chat',
        'action': 'Sent', 'obj': message.id,
        'short_description': 'You a new message', 'url': url,
        'channels': ('email', 'websocket', 'slack'), 'silent': True
    }
    notify(**kwargs)

This example creates a *silent* notification and delivers it via ``email``, ``websocket`` and ``slack``.

This assumes that you've implemented those channels and added them to the ``settings.NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNELS`` dictionary.


Notification Fields
-------------------

The fields in the `args` dictionary map to the fields in the `Notification` model

- **source: A ForeignKey to Django's User model (Can be null if it's not a User to User Notification).**
- **source_display_name: A User Friendly name for the source of the notification.**
- **recipient: The Recipient of the notification. It's a ForeignKey to Django's User model.**
- **category: Arbitrary category that can be used to group messages.**
- **action: Verbal action for the notification E.g Sent, Cancelled, Bought e.t.c**
- **obj: The id of the object associated with the notification (Can be null).**
- **short_description: The body of the notification.**
- **url: The url of the object associated with the notification (Can be null).**
- **silent: If this Value is set, the notification won't be persisted to the database.**
- **extra_data: Arbitrary data as a dictionary.**
- **channels: Delivery channels that should be used to deliver the message (Tuple/List)**

The values of the fields can easily be used to construct the notification message.


Extra/Arbitrary Data
--------------------

Besides the standard fields, django-notifs allows you to attach arbitrary data to a notification.
Simply pass in a dictionary as the extra_data argument.

.. note::
    The dictionary is serialized using python's json module so make sure the dictionary contains objects that can be serialized by the json module

    Internally, the JSON is stored as plain text with django's standard ``TextField``.


Writing custom delivery channels
--------------------------------

django-notifs doesn't just allow you to send in-app notifications. you can also send external notifications 
(Like Emails and SMS) with custom delivery channels. A delivery channel is a python class that provides two methods:

1. ``construct_message`` to construct the message.

2. ``notify`` does the actual sending of the message.

There's a base meta class you can inherit. This is an example of an email delivery channel using `django.core.mail.send_mail`::

    from django.core.mail import send_mail
    from notifications.channels import BaseNotificationChannel


    class EmailNotificationChannel(BaseNotificationChannel):
        """Allows notifications to be sent via email to users."""

        def construct_message(self):
            """Constructs a message from notification arguments."""
            kwargs = self.notification_kwargs
            category = kwargs.get('category', None)
            short_description = kwargs.get('short_description', None)

            message = '{} {} {}'.format(
                kwargs['source_display_name'], kwargs['action'],
                short_description
            )

            return message

        def notify(self, message):
            """Send the notification."""
            subject = 'Notification'
            from_email = 'your@email.com'
            recipient_list = ['example@gmail.com']

            send_mail(subject, message, from_email, recipient_list)

Finally don't forget to tell `django-notifs` about your new Delivery Channel by setting::

    NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNELS = {
        'email': 'path.to.EmailNotificationChannel'
    }


Sending notifications asynchronously
------------------------------------

You don't need to do anything special here because `django-notifs` already installs celery as part of it's dependencies. You just need to setup celery like `you'd normally do`_.

Make sure you have a broker installed (RabbitMQ or Redis) and run celery. Whenever a notification is created, it's automatically sent to celery and processed.

**Make sure you see the task registered under celery as  notifications.tasks.send_notification**

.. image:: _static/images/django-notifs-celery.png

If you have issues registering the task, you can import it manually or checkout the `Celery settings in the repo`_.

If you want to disable celery and send notifications synchronously you can always set ``settings.CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER`` to ``True``.


Reading notifications
---------------------

To read a notification use the read method::

    from notifications.utils import read

    # id of the notification object, you can easily pass this through a URL
    notify_id = request.GET.get('notify_id')

    # Read notification
    if notify_id:
        read(notify_id=notify_id, recipient=request.user)

.. note::
    It's really important to pass the correct recipient to the read signal.

    Internally,it's used to check if the user has the right to read the notification.
    If you pass in the wrong recipient or you omit it entirely, ``django-notifs`` will raise a
    ``NotificationError``


Templates
---------

django-notifs comes with a Context manager that you can use to display notifications in your templates. Include it with::

    'context_processors': [
        ...
        'notifications.notifications.notifications',
        ...
    ]

This makes a user's notifications available in all templates as a template variable named ``"notifications"``
